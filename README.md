This is a beginner level project where I have scraped all pokemon data, game wise as well as national dex data. The main aim is to exract list of pokemon into json and to use the json for an app where I can keep track pf the pokemon I have already caught for respective game

To run the script just run `sh pokemonDataScrapper.sh` in terminal
